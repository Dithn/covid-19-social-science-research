# COVID-19 Social Science Research Tracker
Collaborators: **[J. Nathan Matias](https://natematias.com)** (Cornell University, Communication; [@natematias](https://twitter.com/natematias)), **Alex Leavitt** (Facebook Research, Health Integrity; [@alexleavitt](https://twitter.com/alexleavitt)). 

Social scientists have an important role to serve society during a pandemic. We can do this much better through cooperation. This resource is designed to help us track new social research about COVID 19, including published findings, pre-prints, projects underway, and projects that are at least at a solid proposal stage.

**If you share the tracker online, please link to this document**, so we have resilience/redundancy in the case of any problems with Google Sheets.

* Add your project to this google spreadsheet: **[COVID 19 Social Science Research Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuY8VLV2yG8TAOZbtyNtrhHERmzUjSaXpAo0_59z_XU/edit?ts=5e73b15d#gid=0)**
* If you can't access the spreadsheet, you can use this Google form and we will update the spreadsheet (Link coming Soon)

If you have questions about this resource or want to discuss it with other social scientists, [please use the issue discussion area](https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research/issues) in this repository.

## How to Use the Spreadsheet
### Adding New Entries
By using a Google Spreadsheet, we're able to collect a large number of contributions from many others. However, similar endeavors in the past week have gotten swamped and faced problems with accidental deletions and copy/paste errors. To minimize errors of this kind, we ask you to:
* **Prepare** Before adding to the spreadsheet, prepare your contributions in a separate document, after reading the fields below
* **Type** Rather than copy/pasting large blocks of text into the spreadsheet, please type out your answers. It's okay to paste web links
* **Validate** Review your answers to make sure they're accurate

### Reviewing and Accessing the Spreadsheet
To review spreadsheet contents, **please download the spreadsheet rather than reading/sorting/filtering online**. This will help us minimize errors and prevent disruptions to other people's ability to concentrate. Thanks!

## Responsibility to Update
Please, if you add an entry to this spreadsheet, we ask that you take responsibility to update the link as the status of your project changes. Thanks!

## Fields in the Tracker:
For each project, please plan to enter:
* Status: What is the project's current status?
  * Planning
  * In IRB Review
  * Data Collection

* Lead POC (Name)
* Lead POC Institution
* Primary Research Question
* Method(s)
* Locations Studied
* Anticipated Impact Category (these are based on the three-stage model of pandemic management) 
  * During the **prevention** stage, the goal is to promote behaviors that minimize the spread of the pandemic

  * During the **recovery** stage, the goal is to support re-building and recovery from the pandemic
* Other collaborators (name, institution)
* Stuy Timing. When the study was or will be fielded. If you're not sure yet, leave this blank so we can sort.
* Description of project (100 words max). Say more about how you are going about advancing your research goals. 
* Goals: beyond the specific research question, what do you hope this will achieve?
* Outcome variables or findings: Tell us more about what kinds of things we learn from this research
