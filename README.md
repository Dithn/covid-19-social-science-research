# COVID 19 Social Science Research Tracker

Welcome to the COVID-19 social science project tracker. This initiative is led by Nathan Matias (Cornell University, Communication; @natematias) and Alex Leavitt (Facebook Research, Health Integrity; @alexleavitt). 

If you share the tracker, please link to this document, so we have resilience/redundancy in the case of any problems with Google Sheets.

* Add your project to this google spreadsheet: [COVID 19 Social Science Research Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuY8VLV2yG8TAOZbtyNtrhHERmzUjSaXpAo0_59z_XU/edit?ts=5e73b15d#gid=0)
* If you can't access the spreadsheet, you can use this Google form and we will update the spreadsheet (Link coming Soon)

If you have questions about this resource or want to discuss it with other social scientists, [please use the issue discussion area](https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research/issues) in this repository.
