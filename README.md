Social scientists have an important role during a pandemic. We can do this much better through cooperation. This resource tracks new social research about COVID 19, including published findings, pre-prints, projects underway, and projects at least at a solid proposal stage.

**If you share the tracker, please link to this page**, so we have redundancy in the case of any Google Sheets problems.

* **[Add your project using this Google form](https://forms.gle/K5CUpHYk23XXZSrh7)** and it will be automatically added
* View and update here: **[COVID 19 Social Science Research Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuY8VLV2yG8TAOZbtyNtrhHERmzUjSaXpAo0_59z_XU/edit?ts=5e73b15d#gid=0)**

If you have questions about this resource or want to discuss it with other social scientists, [please use the issue discussion area](https://github.com/natematias/covid-19-social-science-research/issues) in this repository.

## How to Use the Spreadsheet
### Adding New Entries
Please add your entry via the Google form above rather than typing directly into the spreadsheet.

### Reviewing and Accessing the Spreadsheet
To review spreadsheet contents, **please download the spreadsheet rather than reading/sorting/filtering online** if you can. This will help us minimize errors and prevent the sheet from being overwhelmed with readers. 

If you do have the spreadsheet, please **close the tab when you are finished** so other people can view it.

## Responsibility to Update
Please, if you add an entry, we ask that you take responsibility to update the link as the status of your project changes. You can make changes directly to the spreadsheet (but be careful not to over-write other entries). Thanks!

## Fields in the Tracker:
For each project, please plan to enter:
* **Status**: What is the project's current status?
  * Planning
  * In IRB Review
  * Data Collection
