# COVID 19 Social Science Research Tracker

Welcome to the COVID-19 social science project tracker. This initiative is led by Nathan Matias (Cornell University, Communication; @natematias) and Alex Leavitt (Facebook Research, Health Integrity; @alexleavitt). 

If you share the tracker, please link to this document, so we have resilience/redundancy in the case of any problems with Google Sheets.
